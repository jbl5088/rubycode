# You have 100 cats.
#
# Your rules are simple: whenever you visit a cat, you toggle it's hat status (if it
# already has a hat, you remove it.. if it does not have a hat, you put one on).
# All of the cats start hat-less. You cycle through 100 rounds of visiting cats.
# In the 1st round, you visit every cat. In the second round, you visit every other cat.
# In the nth round, you visit every nth cat.. until the 100th round, in which you only
# visit the 100th cat.
#
# At the end of 100 rounds, which cats have hats?
